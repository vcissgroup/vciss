Introduction

Proven, solutions architect having designed a repeatable process relative to virtual hosted applications, architecture, application lifecycle, hardware refresh lifecycles, corporate trainer with 100 and more recommendations, awards, pertaining to Private Cloud with emphasis on solutions designed to exceed the needs of the end-users that appreciate a solution providing 10 or less second logon, one Web GUI for all applications, by default high-availability on what I have coined “VOS” as Virtual Operating System capable of withstanding several outages in the data center and zero impact to the VOS, offline for Microsoft Patches only due to separation of all applications from the desktop, customer inspired unique authentication design allowing for customized VOS using on template for the entire company yet ability for customer to choose logon banners, drastic reduction of logon scripts required for applications by moving this and other logic to the published application, drastic reduction of network aggregate bandwidth requirements per site and working with third-party vendor before and after to determine CIR adjustments where monthly costs for bandwidth has become the most beneficial OPEX savings for some companies.

Emphasis on EUC satisfaction in the production solution is critical and most important in all my implementations closely followed by a paradigm impact to all internal IT teams where the focus is making life easier for IT services from operations, Windows, Desktop Support, Help Desk, Storage, Networking, Firewall Team, efficiency impacts for business units requesting access to business applications and IT Security Fulfillment or HR, in some cases, with the goal being streamline the entire procurement process by focusing on the Corporate Business Applications, proven repeatable process for migration of all COTS, internal developed, external developed, direct vendor managed, basically having a strategy that addresses the consolidation of all business applications to a centralized location regardless of the number of applications; hence, the term repeatable in practical use doesn’t care if I migrate 3000 applications or 300 – it just works and leveraging published best practices.  

The unique design, combined with a proven project plan, workflows, escalation paths, application lifecycle proprietary process including custom agreements with Help Desk management and Change Control management team approvals new process is immediately implemented with a customized letter sent to all Business Unit management to emphasize the critical role of allocating 1 to 3 power user UAT resources whereby user is shadowed during UAT to assist with creating of application run books which helps shift priority of success relative to new production applications working in a shared private cloud to-be environment and prevents end users from pointing the finger immediately at the new solution when evidence is provided showing the power user provided did not UAT that report or that query.
